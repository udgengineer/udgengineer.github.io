# Project analysis CV Website

## User profile

The target users of this website are **recruiters or hiring managers in the IT sector** who want to quickly assess a candidate's skills, education, and professional experience. These users typically need the following:

- Access to information in a **clear and organized manner**, without distractions or irrelevant content.  
- Quickly evaluate technical skills, certifications, and work experience.  
- Benefit from a **professional and simple presentation** that facilitates fast reading and objective assessment.

Overall, the website needs to provide a **digital CV** that allows recruiters and hiring managers to quickly and efficiently review a candidate’s qualifications and experience, focusing on clarity, relevance, and ease of use.



## Information Architecture

The information on the page is organized in a **logical and simple way** to facilitate quick and effective reading by the user. The information is presented in the following way:

- First, we show our **personal and contact details**. This section ensures that the user can easily identify us and has immediate ways to communicate through email, phone, or professional networks.

- Second, we present our **academic background along with certifications**. This allows the user to clearly assess our educational qualifications and professional development.

- Third, we display our **technical skills** divided into three blocks: frontend, backend, and other tools. This structure highlights our expertise in specific areas of development. Next to the skills, we include the **languages that we speak** with visual indicators of proficiency, making it easy for the user to understand our linguistic capabilities.

- Fourth, we present our **work experience** with detailed descriptions of each position, responsibilities, and achievements. This helps the user understand our career progression, professional accomplishments, and the skills acquired in each role.

- Finally, we showcase **notable projects** with brief descriptions and the technologies used. This section provides concrete examples of our work, illustrating practical application of skills in real-world scenarios.  

This organization creates a **natural flow from general to specific information**, improving the user experience and enhancing the effectiveness of communication.


## Visual design

The overall design of the page is based on many examples of curriculums I found online. Most curriculums follow a pattern that I found very practical: a **highlighted block of personal** information (usually at the top or on the left) and a **separate block with more technical detail**s, such as experience, skills, and projects. I followed this structure because it makes it easier for the user to see the most important information first and then check the other details.

To highlight the personal information section, I used the blue color because, after researching online, I found that this color is highly recommended for professional curriculums in the IT sector. This is because the color is associated with reliability, integrity, and professionalism ([curriculumytrabajo.com/color-cv](https://curriculumytrabajo.com/color-cv/)). I selected the shade "Lowes Blue" from ([cssgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/shades-of-blue/)) to ensure that I was using a color with a standard and recognizable name.

For the Figma design, I used the icons and components available in Figma, but there were some icons that I couldn’t find in Figma, so I obtained them from other websites ([svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/)). I used these icons because they help visually identify the sections of the page and make it more visually appealing (without icons, the page does not look professional). In addition to icons, I also searched online for a professional photo, and I found one on this website ([unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/es/fotos/hombre-que-lleva-el-retrato-superior-de-henley-7YVZYZeITc8)). Apart from that, to make the page more professional, I changed the default font to Roboto, because the Roboto font is simple, easy to read, and also looks stylish.

Overall, the design seeks to strike a balance between clarity, professionalism, and pleasing aesthetics, so that the information is easy to read and users can focus on what is most important.

## Additional information

To create the website, I used Bootstrap to facilitate responsive design and components such as icons. Without Bootstrap, the development would have taken more time. Since I already have experience with Bootstrap, for me it was much easier to use it than to build everything from scratch.

To create this README I used tools to translate text like ([deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/es/translator)) and tools to verify the syntax and professional quality like ([chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/)).
